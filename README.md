options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Enable debug output.
  -l IP:port            IP and port to listen on.
  -m mod1,mod2,...      Modules to enable.
  -M, --modules         List available modules.
  -C scanID, --correlate scanID
                        Run correlation rules against a scan ID.
  -s TARGET             Target for the scan.
  -t type1,type2,...    Event types to collect (modules selected
                        automatically).
  -u {all,footprint,investigate,passive}
                        Select modules automatically by use case
  -T, --types           List available event types.
  -o {tab,csv,json}     Output format. Tab is default.
  -H                    Don't print field headers, just data.
  -n                    Strip newlines from data.
  -r                    Include the source data field in tab/csv output.
  -S LENGTH             Maximum data length to display. By default, all data
                        is shown.
  -D DELIMITER          Delimiter to use for CSV output. Default is ,.

  -x                    STRICT MODE. Will only enable modules that can
                        directly consume your target, and if -t was specified
                        only those events will be consumed by modules. This
                        overrides -t and -m options.
  -q                    Disable logging. This will also hide errors!
